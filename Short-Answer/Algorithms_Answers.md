#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) Its one loop within like one pass through


b)O(n log n) This has to loop through 2 times 


c)O(n) only one pass to go over and calls itself

## Exercise II

if you have alot of eggs and trying to determin what f floor is, you would drop and egg on each floor to see if it breaks or not. so that would be a loop then have a counter to keep track of the eggs and the broken ones. i think you can get the floors number by the eggs. o(n)

or the right the right way using 0(log n)

go to the middle of the floors (cut in half) and drop an egg see if it brakes then keep cutting it in half until it doesnt break saves alot more eggs then the other way.
